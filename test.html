            <p>Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main
                constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital
                for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical
                formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected
                by covalent bonds. Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and
                pressure. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed
                from suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may
                precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water moves
                continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation,
                precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.</p>
            <p>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans. Small portions of water occur as
                groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air
                as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%).</p>
            <p>Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans
                goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of
                the world. Much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured
                products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water,
                ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent
                for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in
                cooking and washing. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as
                swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, and diving.</p>
