## Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-product-landing-page.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-product-landing-page)

This site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-product-landing-page.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-product-landing-page?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses HTML5, CSS3, and a little JavaScript to provide an example of a product landing page.
Additionally, this project has a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis, with a Gulp file, and deployment to GitHub pages.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page.
